\abstractTitle

 The Mordell-Weil Theorem states that if $K$ is a number field and $E/K$ is an elliptic curve that the group of $K$-rational point $E(K)$ is a finitely generated abelian group, i.e. $E(K) \cong \Z^{r_K} \oplus E(K)_\tors$ where $r_K$ is the rank and $E(K)_\tors$ is the subgroup of torsion points on $E$. Unfortunately, very little is known about the rank $r_K$. Even in the case of $K= \Q$, it is not known which ranks are possible or if the ranks are bounded. However, there has been great strides in determining the sets $E(K)_\tors$. 
 
 
Progress began in 1977 with Mazur's classification of the possible torsion subgroups for rational elliptic curves $E(\Q)_\tors$, and there has seen been an explosion of classifications. The possible structures for $E(K)_\tors$ is known for elliptic curves over number fields of degree $d= 2, 3$ and which ones occur infinitely often for $d= 4, 5, 6$. When restricting to rational elliptic curves or elliptic curves with CM, there is even greater progress. For instance, the torsion structures for $E(K)_\tors$ are known for number fields of degree $d= 1, 2, \ldots, 12$. 


Inspired by work of Chou, \gonjim{}, \lozrob{}, and Najman, the purpose of this work is to classify the sets $\Phi_\Q^{\Gal}(9)$, the set of possible torsion subgroups for rational elliptic curves over nonic Galois fields. We determine that there are 22 possible isomorphism classes of torsion subgroups for rational elliptic curves over nonic Galois number fields. Furthermore, we classify the possible torsion structures based on the isomorphism type of $\Gal(K/\Q)$. Finally, extending these techniques, we completely determine the sets $\Phi_\Q^{\Gal}(d)$ for any odd integer $d$, and prove a number of other related results.
