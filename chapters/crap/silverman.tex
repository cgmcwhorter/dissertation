%% Silverman - Rational Points on Elliptic Curves
%
%Why have we concentrated attention only on non-singular cubics? It is not just to be fussy. Singular cubics and non-singular cubics have completely different sorts of behavior. For instance, singular cubics are just as easy to treat as conics. If we project from the singular point onto some line, we see that the line going through that singular point meets the cubic twice at the singular point, so it meets the cubic only once more. The projection of a singular cubic curve onto a line is thus one-to-one. So just as for a conic, the rational points on a singular cubic can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the rational points on a line. In fact, it is very easy do so explicitly with formulas.
%
%So the rational points on singular cubics are trivial to analyze, and Mordell‚Äôs theorem does not hold for them. Actually, we have not yet explained how to get a group law for these singular curves, but if one avoids the singularity and uses the procedure that we described earlier, then one does get a group. We will study these singular groups in more detail at the end of Chapter 3, and in particular we will see that they are not finitely generated.
%
%
%% Points Order 2
%Which points in our group satisfy $2P= O$, but $P \neq O$? Instead of $2P= O$, it is easier to look at the equivalent condition $P= -P$ . Since $-(x, y)= (x, -y)$, these are just the points with $y= 0$, i.e., the points $P_1= (\alpha_1,0)$, $P_2= (\alpha_2,0)$, $P_3= (\alpha_3,0)$, where $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$ are the (complex) roots of the cubic polynomial f(x). So if we allow complex coordinates, there are exactly three points of order two, because the non-singularity of the curve ensures that $f(x)$ has distinct roots.
%
%
%If we take all of the points satisfying $2P= O$, including $P= O$, then we get the set $\{O, P_1, P_2, P_3 \}$. It is easily seen that in any abelian group, the set of solutions to the equation $2P= O$ forms a subgroup. (More generally, for any $m$, the set of solutions to $mP= O$ forms a subgroup.) So we have an abelian group of order four, and since every element has order one or two, it is clear that this group is the Four Group, i.e., a direct product of two groups of order two. This means that the sum of any two of the points $P_1, P_2, P_3$ should equal the third, which is obvious from the fact that the three points are colinear. So now we know exactly what the group of points $P$ such that $2P= O$ looks like. If we allow complex coordinates, it is the Four Group. If we allow only real coordinates, it is either the Four Group or a cyclic group of order two, depending on whether $f(x)$ has three real roots or one real root. And if we restrict attention to points with rational coordinates, there are three possibilities, it is either the Four Group, cyclic of order two, or trivial, depending on whether $f(x)$ has three, one, or zero rational roots.
%
%
%Next we look at the points of order three. Instead of $3P= O$, we write $2P= -P$, so a point of order three will satisfy $x(2P)= x(-P)= x(P)$. Conversely, if $P \neq O$ satisfies $x(2P)= x(P)$, then $2P = \pm P$, so either $P = O$ (excluded by our assumption) or $3P= O$. In other words, the points of order three are exactly the points satisfying $x(2P)= x(P)$. 
%
%
%To find the points satisfying these conditions, we use the duplication formula and set the $x$-coordinate of $2P$ equal to the $x$-coordinate of $P$. If we write $P= (x,y)$, then we have shown in Section 1.4 that the $x$-coordinate of $2P$ equals
%	\[
%	\dfrac{x^4 - 2bx^2 - 8cx + b^2 - 4ac}{4x^3 + 4ax^2 + 4bx + 4c}
%	\]
%
%Setting this expression equal to $x$, cross-multiplying, and doing a little algebra, we have that a point $P= (x,y) \neq O$ on $C$ has order three if and only if $x$ is a root of the polynomial
%	\[
%	\psi_3(x)= 3x^4 + 4ax^3 + 6bx^2 + 12cx + 4ac - b^2
%	\]
%
%
%%Let Œ≤1, Œ≤2, Œ≤3, Œ≤4 be the four complex root of œà3(x), and for each Œ≤i, let Ùè∞¢
%%Œ¥i be one of the square roots Œ¥i = f(Œ≤i). Then from (c), the set Ùè∞Ç(Œ≤1, ¬±Œ¥1), (Œ≤2, ¬±Œ¥2), (Œ≤3, ¬±Œ¥3), (Œ≤4, ¬±Œ¥4)Ùè∞É
%%is the complete set of points of order three on C. Further, we observe that no Œ¥i can equal zero, because otherwise the point (Œ≤i, Œ¥i) = (Œ≤i, 0) would have order two, contradicting the fact that it has order three. Therefore the set contains eight distinct points, so C contains eight points of order three. The only other point on C with order dividing three is the point of order one, namely O, which completes the proof that C has exactly nine points of order dividing three.
%
%
%We have subgroups
%	\[
%	\{ O \} \subset C(\Q) \subset C(\R) \subset C(\C)
%	\]
%It is intuitively clear that the addition of real points on the curve is continuous, since if we move two points a little bit, the line connecting them and the third intersection point with C also move just a little bit. So the group of real points is a one-dimensional Lie group, and it is in fact compact, although it does not look it, because it has the point at infinity. There is only one such connected group. Any one-dimensional compact connected Lie group is isomorphic to the group of rotations of the circle, that is, the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value one. So if the group of real points on the curve is connected, then it is isomorphic to the circle group, and in any case, the component of the curve that contains O is isomorphic to the circle group. And from this description, we can immediately see what the real points of finite order look like.
%
%
%So if $C(\R)$ has one component, then the points of order dividing $m$ in $C(\R)$ form a cyclic group of order $m$. If there are two connected components, then the group $C(\R)$ is the direct product of the circle group with a group of order two. In this case, there are two possibilities for the points of order dividing $m$. If $m$ is odd, we again get a cyclic group of order $m$, whereas if $m$ is even, then we find the direct product of a cyclic group of order two and a cyclic group of order $m$.
%
%
%In particular, we see that the real points of order dividing three always form a cyclic group of order three. Since we saw in Section 2.1 that there are eight complex points of order three, it is never possible for all of the complex points of order three to be real, and certainly they cannot all be rational. Notice that the $x$-coordinates of the points of order three are the roots of the quartic polynomial $\psi_3(x)$ described in Section 2.1. This quartic has real coefficients, so it has either zero, two, or four real roots. Since each $x$ gives two possible values for $y$, this shows that the curve has either zero, four, or eight points of order three with real $x$-coordinate. However, our discussion shows that there must be exactly one real value of $x$ for which the two corresponding $y$‚Äôs are real. This can also be proven directly from the equations, a task that we leave for the exercises.

%The proofs of Siegel‚Äôs and Thue‚Äôs theorems have one other thing in com- mon with the proof of Mordell‚Äôs theorem. Recall that although Mordell‚Äôs the- orem tells us that the group of rational points is finitely generated, it does not provide a guaranteed method for finding generators. Similarly, Siegel‚Äôs and Thue‚Äôs theorems tell us that the set of points with integer coordinates is finite, but their proofs do not provide us with a method that is guaranteed to find all of the integer points. In the 1930s, Skolem [50] came up with a new proof of Siegel‚Äôs theorem that, in practice, often allows one to find all solutions, but it, too, was not guaranteed to work. Finally, in 1966, Baker [2] gave an effective method for finding all solutions.

%
%\begin{dfn}
%Affine $n$-space (over $K$) is the set of $n$-tuples
%	\[
%	\A^n= \A^n(\ov{K})= \{ P= (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \colon x_i \in \ov{K} \}
%	\]
%Similarly, the set of $K$-rational points of $\A^n$ is the set
%	\[
%	\A^n(K)= \{ P= (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \A^n \colon x_i \in K \}
%	\]
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%Notice that the Galois group $G_{\ov{K}/K}$ acts on $\A^n$ for $\sigma \in G_{\ov{K}/K}$ and $P \in \A^n$,
%	\[
%	P^\sigma= (x_1^\sigma, \ldots, x_n^\sigma)
%	\]
%Then $\A^n(K)$ may be characterized by
%	\[
%	\A^n(K)= \{ P \in \A^n \colon P^\sigma= P \text{ for all } \sigma \in G_{\ov{K}/K} \}
%	\]
%
%Let $\ov{K}[X]= \ov{K}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ be a polynomial ring in $n$ variables, and let $I \subset \ov{K}[X]$ be an ideal. To each $I$ we associate a subset of $\A^n$
%	\[
%	V_I= \{ P \in \A^n \colon f(P)= 0 \text{ for all } P \in V \}
%	\]
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%An (affine) algebraic set is any set of the form $V_I$. If $V$ is an algebraic set, the ideal of $V$ is given by
%	\[
%	I(V)= \{ f \in \ov{K}[X] \colon f(P)= 0 \text{ for all } P \in V \}
%	\]
%An algebraic set is defined over $K$ if its ideal $I(V)$ can be generated by polynomials in $K[X]$. We denote this by $V/K$. If $V$ is defined over $K$, then the set of $K$-rational points of $V$ is the set 
%	\[
%	V(K)= V \cap \A^n(K)
%	\]
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%Note that by the Hilbert basis theorem, [8, 7.6], [73, \S1.4], all ideals in $\ov{K}[X]$ and $K[X]$ are finitely generated. 
%
%
%\begin{rem} % 1.2
%Let $V$ be an algebraic set, and consider the ideal $I(V/K)$ defined by
%	\[
%	I(V/K)= \{ f \in K[X] \colon f(P)= 0 \text{ for all } P \in V \}= I(V) \cap K[X]
%	\]
%Then we see that $V$ is defined over $K$ if and only if 
%	\[
%	I(V)= I(V/K) \ov{K}[X]
%	\]
%Now suppose that $V$ is defined over $K$ and let $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in K[X]$ be generators for $I(V/K)$. Then $V(K)$ is precisely the set of solutions $(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ to the simultaneous polynomial equations
%	\[
%	f_1(X)= \cdots = f_m(X) = 0 \text{ with } x_1,\ldots,x_n \in K
%	\]
%Thus one of the fundamental problems in the subject of Diophantine geometry, namely the solution of polynomial equations in rational numbers, may be said to be the problem of describing sets of the form $V(K)$ when $K$ is a number field.
%\end{rem}
%
%
%Notice that if $f(X) \in K[X]$ and $P \in \A^n$, then for any $\sigma \in G_{\ov{K}/K}$
%	\[
%	f(P^\sigma)= f(P)^\sigma
%	\]
%Hence if $V$ is defined over $K$, the action of $G_{\ov{K}/K}$ on $\A^n$ induces an action on $V$, and clearly
%	\[
%	V(K)= \{ P \in V \colon P^\sigma= P \text{ for all } \sigma \in G_{\ov{K}/K} \}
%	\]
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%An affine algebraic set $V$ is called an (affine) variety if $I(V)$ is a prime ideal in $\ov{K}[X]$. Note that if $V$ is defined over $K$, it is not enough to check that $I(V/K)$ is prime in $K[X]$. 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%Let $V/K$ be a variety, i.e. $V$ is a variety defined over $K$. Then the affine coordinate ring of $V/K$ is defined by
%	\[
%	K[V]= \dfrac{K[X]}{I(V/K)}
%	\]
%The ring $K[V]$ is an integral domain. Its quotient field is denoted by $K(V)$ and is called the function field of $V/K$. Similarly, $\ov{K}[V]$ and $\ov{K}(V)$ are defined by replacing $K$ with $\ov{K}$. 
%
%
%Note that since an element $f \in \ov{K}[V]$ is well-defined up to adding a polynomial vanishing on $V$, it induces a well-defined function $f: V \to \ov{K}$. If $f(X) \in \ov{K}[X]$ is any polynomial, then $G_{\ov{K}/K}$ acts on $f$ by acting on its coefficients. Hence if $V$ is defined over $K$, so $G_{\ov{K}/K}$ takes $I(V)$ into itself, then we obtain an action of $G_{\ov{K}/K}$ on $\ov{K}[V]$ and $\ov{K}(V)$. One can check that $K[V]$ and $K(V)$ are, respectively, the subsets of $\ov{K}[V]$ and $\ov{K}(V)$ fixed by $G_{\ov{K}/K}$. We denote the action of $\sigma \in G_{\ov{K}/K}$ on $f$ by $f \mapsto f^\sigma$. Then for all points $P \in V$
%	\[
%	\big( f(P) \big)^\sigma= f^\sigma(P^\sigma)
%	\]
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%Let $V$ be a variety. The dimension of $V$, denoted by $\dim V$, is the transcendence degree of $\ov{K}(V)$ over $\ov{K}$. 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%Let $V$ ba variety, $P \in V$, and $f_1, \ldots, f_m \in \ov{K}[X]$ a set of generators for $I(V)$. Then $V$ is nonsingular (or smooth) at $P$ if the $m \times n$ matrix
%	\[
%	\left( \dfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial X_j}\, (P) \right)_{\substack{1 \leq i \leq m \\ 1 \leq j \leq n}}
%	\]
%has $\rank n - \dim V$. If $V$ is nonsingular at every point, then we say that $V$ is nonsingular (or smooth). 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%There is another characterization of smoothness, in terms of the functions on the variety $V$, that is often quite useful. For each point $P \in V$, we define an ideal $M_P$ of $\ov{K}[V]$ by
%	\[
%	M_P= \{ f \in \ov{K}[V] \colon f(P)= 0 \}
%	\]
%Notice that $M_P$ is a maximal ideal, since there is an isomorphism
%	\[
%	\ov{K}[V]/M_P \to \ov{K} \text{ given by } f \mapsto f(P)
%	\]
%The quotient $M_P/M_P^2$ is a finite-dimensional $\ov{K}$-vector space. 
%
%
%\begin{prop} % 1.7
%Let $V$ be a variety. A point $P \in V$ is nonsingular if and only if
%	\[
%	\dim_{\ov{K}} M_P/M_P^2= \dim V
%	\]
%\end{prop}
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%The local ring of $V$ at $P$, denoted by $\ov{K}[V]_P$, is the localization of $\ov{K}[V]$ at $M_P$. In other words,
%	\[
%	\ov{K}[V]_P= \{ F \in \ov{K}(V) \colon F= f/g \text{ for some } f,g \in \ov{K}[V] \text{ with } g(P) \neq 0 \}
%	\]
%Notice that if $F= f/g \in \ov{K}[V]_P$, then $F(P)= f(P)/g(P)$ is well-defined. The functions in $\ov{K}[V]_P$ are said to be regular (or defined) at $P$.

%% Divisors
%\subsection{Divisors} % p 27
%
%The divisor group of a curve $C$, denoted by $\Div(C)$, is the free abelian group generated by the points of $C$. Thus a divisor $D \in \Div C$ is a formal sum
%	\[
%	D= \sum_{P \in C} n_P(P)
%	\]
%where $n_P \in \Z$ and $n_P= 0$ for all but finitely many $P \in C$. The degree of $D$ is defined by
%	\[
%	\deg D= \sum_{P \in C} n_P
%	\]
%The divisors of degree 0 form a subgroup of $\Div(C)$, which we denote by
%	\[
%	\Div^0(C)= \{ D \in \Div(C) \colon \deg D= 0 \}
%	\]
%If $C$ is defined over $K$, we let $G_{\ov{K}/K}$ act on $\Div(C)$ and $\Div^0(C)$ in the obvious way
%	\[
%	D^\sigma= \sum_{P \in C} p_P(P^\sigma)
%	\]
%Then $D$ is defined over $K$ if $D^\sigma= D$ for all $\sigma \in G_{\ov{K}/K}$. We note that if $D= n_1(P_1) + \cdots + n_r(P_r)$ with $n_1, \ldots, n_r \neq 0$, then to say that $D$ is defined over $K$ does not mean that $P_1, \ldots, P_r \in C(K)$. It suffices for the group $G_{\ov{K}/K}$ to permute the $P_i$'s in an appropriate fashion. We denote the group of divisors defined over $K$ by $\Div_K(C)$, and similarly for $\Div_K^0(C)$.
%
%
%Assume now that the curve $C$ is smooth, and let $f \in \ov{K}(C)^*$. Then we can associate to $f$ the divisor $\div f$ given by
%	\[
%	\div f= \sum_{P \in C} \ord_P(f)(P)
%	\]
%This is a divisor by II.1.2. If $\sigma \in G_{\ov{K}/K}$, then it is easy to see that
%	\[
%	\div(f^\sigma)= (\div f)^\sigma
%	\]
%In particular, if $f \in K(C)$, then $\div f \in \Div_K(C)$. Since each $\ord_P$ is a valuation, the map
%	\[
%	\div: \ov{K}(C)^* \to \Div C
%	\]
%is a homomorphism of abelian groups. It is analogous to the map that sends an element of a number field to the corresponding fractional ideal. This prompts the following definitions.
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%A divisor $D \in \Div C$ is principal if it has the form $D= \div f$ for some $f \in \ov{K}(C)^*$. Two divisors are linearly equivalent, written $D_1 \sim D_2$, if $D_1 - D_2$ is principal. The divisor class group (or Picard group) of $C$, denoted $\Pic C$, is the quotient of $\Div C$ by its subgroup of principal divisors. We let $\Pic_K C$ be the subgroup of $\Pic C$ fixed by $G_{\ov{K}/K}$. In general, $\Pic_K C$ is not the quotient of $\Div_K C$ by its subgroup of principal divisors.

%\begin{dfn}
%It follows from II.3.1b that the principal divisors from a subgroup of $\Div^0(C)$. We define the degree-0 part of the divisor class group of $C$ to be the quotient of $\Div^0(C)$ by the subgroup of principal divisors. We denote this group by $\Pic^0(C)$. Similarly, we write $\Pic_K^0(C)$ for the subgroup of $\Pic^0(C)$ fixed by $G_{\ov{K}/K}$. 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%The above definitions and II.3.1 may be summarized by saying that there is an exact sequence
%	\[
%	1 \ma{} \ov{K}^* \ma{} \ov{K}(C)^* \ma{\div} \Div^0(C) \ma{} \Pic^0(C) \ma{} 0
%	\]
%
%
%Let $\phi: C_1 \to C_2$ be a nonconstant map of smooth curves. As we have seen, $\phi$ induces maps on the function fields of $C_1$ and $C_2$. 
%	\[
%	\phi^*: \ov{K}(C_2) \to \ov{K}(C_1) \text{ and } \phi_* \ov{K}(C_1) \to \ov{K}(C_2)
%	\]
%We similarly define maps of divisor groups as follows:
%	\[
%	\begin{aligned}
%	\phi^*: \Div(C_2) &\to \Div(C_1) & & \phi_*: \Div(C_1) &\to \Div(C_2) \\
%	(Q) &\mapsto \sum_{P \in \phi^{-1}(Q)} e_\phi(P)(P) & & (P)&\mapsto (\phi P)

%and extend $\Z$-linearly to arbitrary divisors.

%% Differentials
%\subsection{Differentials} % p 30
%
%In this section we discuss the vector space of differential forms on a curve. This vector space serves two distinct purposes. First, it performs the traditional calculus role of linearization. (See (III \S5), especially (III.5.2).) Second, it gives a useful criterion for determining when an algebraic map is separable. (See (II.4.2) and its utilization in the proof of (III.5.5).) Of course, the latter is also a familiar use of calculus, since a field extension is separable if and only if the minimal polynomial of each element has a nonzero derivative
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%Let $C$ be a curve. The \emph{space of (meromorphic) differential forms} on $C$, denoted by $\Omega_C$, is the $\ov{K}(C)$-vector space generated by symbols of the form $dx$ for $x \in \ov{K}(C)$, subject to the usual relations:
%	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
%	\item $d(x + y)= dx + dy$ for all $x, y \in \ov{K}(C)$
%	\item $d(xy)= x \,dy + y \,dx$ for all $x, y \in \ov{K}(C)$
%	\item $da= 0$ for all $a \in \ov{K}$
%	\end{enumerate}
%\end{dfn}
%
%Remark 4.1. There is, of course, a functorial definition of $\Omega_C$ . See, for example, [164, Chapter 10], [111, II.8], or [210, II \S3].
%
%
%Let $\phi: C_1 \to C_2$ be a nonconstant map of curves. The associated function field map $\phi^*: \ov{K}(C_2) \to \ov{K}(C_1)$ induces a map on differentials,
%	\[
%	\phi^*: \Omega_{C_2} \to \Omega_{C_1}, \quad \phi^* \left( \sum f_i \,dx_i \right)= \sum (\phi^* f_i) d(\phi^*x_i)
%	\]
%This map provides a useful criterion for determining when $\phi$ is separable.
%
%
%\begin{prop} % 4.2
%Let $C$ be a curve.
%
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item $\Omega_C$ is a 1-dimensional $\ov{K}(C)$-vector space.
%

%\begin{prop} % 4.3
%Let $C$ be a curve, let $P \in C$, and let $t \in \ov{K}(C)$ be a uniformizer at $P$.
%
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item For every $\omega \in \Omega_C$ there exists a unique function $g \in \ov{K}(C)$, depending on $\omega$ and $t$, satisfying

%depends only on $\omega$ and $P$, independent of the choice of uniformizer $t$. We call this value the order of $\omega$ at $P$ and denote it by $\ord_P(\omega)$. 
%
%\item Let $x, f \in \ov{K}(C)$ with $x(P)= 0$, and let $p= \ch K$. Then

%The differential $\omega \in \Omega_C$ is \emph{regular} (or \emph{holomorphic}) if

%%Remark 4.4. If œâ1,œâ2 ‚àà Œ©C are nonzero differentials, then (II.4.2a) implies that
%%there is a function f ‚àà K ÃÑ(C)‚àó such that œâ1 = fœâ2. Thus div(œâ1) = div(f) + div(œâ2),
%%which shows that the following definition makes sense.
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%The \emph{canonical divisor class on} $C$ is the image in $\Pic(C)$ of $\div(\omega)$ for any nonzero differential $\omega \in \Omega_C$. Any divisor in this divisor class is called a \emph{canonical divisor}. 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%%Example 4.5. We are going to show that there are no holomorphic differentials on P1. First, if t is a coordinate function on P1, then
%%div(dt) = ‚àí2(‚àû).
%%
%%T o s e e t h i s , n o t e t h a t f o r a l l Œ± ‚àà K ÃÑ , t h e f u n c t i o n t ‚àí Œ± i s a u n i f o r m i z e r a t Œ± , s o Ùè∞ÜÙè∞á
%%ordŒ±(dt) = ordŒ± d(t ‚àí Œ±) = 0.
%%However, at ‚àû ‚àà P1 we need to use a function such as 1/t as our uniformizer, so
%%Ùè∞Ñ Ùè∞ÑÙè∞ÖÙè∞Ö
%%ord‚àû(dt) = ord‚àû ‚àít2 d 1 = ‚àí2. t
%%Thus dt is not holomorphic. But now for any nonzero œâ ‚àà Œ©P1 , we can use (II.4.3a) to compute
%%deg div(œâ) = deg div(dt) = ‚àí2, so œâ cannot be holomorphic either.
%
%
%%Example 4.6. Let C be the curve
%%C:y2 =(x‚àíe1)(x‚àíe2)(x‚àíe3),
%%where we continue with the notation from (II.3.3). Then
%%div(dx) = (P1) + (P2) + (P3) ‚àí 3(P‚àû). (Note that dx = d(x ‚àí ei) = ‚àíx2 d(1/x).) We thus see that
%%div(dx/y) = 0.
%%Hence the differential dx/y is both holomorphic and nonvanishing.

%% Riemann-Roch Theorem
%\subsection{Riemann-Roch Theorem} % p 33
%
%Let $C$ be a curve. We put a partial order on $\Div(C)$ in the following way. 
%
%\begin{dfn}
%A divisor $D= \sum n_P(P)$ is \emph{positive} (or \emph{effective}), denoted by
%	\[
%	D \geq 0,
%	\]
%if $n_P \geq 0$ for every $P \in C$. Similarly, for any two divisors $D_1, D_2 \in \Div(C)$, we write
%	\[
%	D_1 \geq D_2
%	\]
%to indicate that $D_1 - D_2$ is positive. 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%%Example 5.1. Let f ‚àà K ÃÑ(C)‚àó be a function that is regular everywhere except at one point P ‚àà C, and suppose that it has a pole of order at most n at P. These requirements on f may be succinctly summarized by the inequality
%%Similarly,
%%div(f ) ‚â• ‚àín(P ). div(f) ‚â• (Q) ‚àí n(P)
%%says that in addition, f has a zero at Q. Thus divisorial inequalities are a useful tool for describing poles and/or zeros of functions.
%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%Let $D \in \Div(C)$. We associate to $D$ the set of functions
%	\[
%	\cL(D)= \{ f \in \ov{K}(C)^* \colon \div(f) \geq -D \} \cup \{ 0 \}
%	\]
%The set $\cL(D)$ is a finite-dimensional $\ov{K}$-vector space (see II.5.2b below), and we denote its dimension by $\ell(D)= \dim_{\ov{K}} \cL(D)$. 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%\begin{prop} % 5.2
%Let $D \in \Div(C)$.
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item If $\deg D < 0$, then
%	\[
%	\cL(D)= \{ 0 \} \text{ and } \ell(D)= 0
%	\]
%
%\item $\cL(D)$ is a finite-dimensional $\ov{K}$-vector space.
%
%\item If $D' \in \Div(C)$ is linearly equivalent to $D$, then
%	\[
%	\cL(D) \cong \cL(D'), \text{ and so } \ell(D)= \ell(D')
%	\]
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{prop}
%
%
%%Example 5.3. Let KC ‚àà Div(C) be a canonical divisor on C, say
%%KC = div(œâ). Then each function f ‚àà L(KC ) has the property that
%%div(f ) ‚â• ‚àí div(œâ), so div(f œâ) ‚â• 0.
%%In other words, f œâ is holomorphic. Conversely, if the differential f œâ is holomorphic, then f ‚àà L(KC ). Since every differential on C has the form f œâ for some f , we have established an isomorphism of K ÃÑ -vector spaces,
%%L(KC ) ‚àº= {œâ ‚àà Œ©C : œâ is holomorphic}.
%%The dimension l(KC ) of these spaces is an important invariant of the curve C .
%
%We are now ready to state a fundamental result in the algebraic geometry of curves. Its importance, as we will see amply demonstrated in (III \S3), lies in its ability to tell us that there are functions on C having prescribed zeros and poles.
%
%
%\begin{thm}[Riemann-Roch]
%Let $C$ be a smooth curve and let $K_C$ be a canonical divisor on $C$. There is an integer $g \geq 0$, called the genus of $C$, such that for every divisor $D \in \Div(C)$,
%	\[
%	\ell(D) - \ell(K_C - D)= \deg D - g + 1
%	\]
%\end{thm}
%
%PROOF. For a fancy proof using Serre duality, see [111, IV \S1]. A more elementary
%proof, due to Weil, is given in [136, Chapter 1].
%
%
%\begin{cor} \hfill % 5.5

%\item $\deg K_C= 2g - 2$
%\item If $\deg D > 2g - 2$, then
%	\[
%	\ell(D)= \deg D - g + 1
%	\]
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{cor}
%
%%Example 5.6. Let C = P1. Then (II.4.5) says that there are no holomorphic dif- ferentials on C, so using the identification from (II.5.3), we see that l(KC) = 0. Then (II.5.5a) says that P1 has genus 0, and the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem reads
%%l(D) ‚àí l(‚àí2(‚àû) ‚àí D) = deg D + 1. In particular, if deg D ‚â• ‚àí1, then
%%l(D) = deg D + 1.
%%(See Exercise 2.3b.)
%
%%Example 5.7. Let C be the curve
%%C:y2 =(x‚àíe1)(x‚àíe2)(x‚àíe3),

%%Ùè∞ÜÙè∞á Ùè∞ÜÙè∞á
%%Let P ‚àà C. Then l (P) = 1. But L (P) certainly contains the constant functions, which have no poles, so this shows that there are no functions on C having a single simple pole.

%%Now we observe that the seven functions 1, x, y, x2, xy, x3, y2 are all in LÙè∞Ü6(P‚àû)Ùè∞á, but lÙè∞Ü6(P‚àû)Ùè∞á = 6, so these seven functions must be K ÃÑ -linearly dependent. Of course, the equation y2 = (x ‚àí e1)(x ‚àí e2)(x ‚àí e3) used to define C gives an equation of linear dependence among them.

%The next result says that if $C$ and $D$ are defined over $K$, then so is $\cL(D)$.

%\subsection{The Invariant Differential} % p 75
%
%Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve given the usual Weierstrass equation
%	\[
%	E: y^2 + a_1 xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6

%We have seen (III.1.5) that the differential 
%	\[
%	\omega= \dfrac{dx}{2y + a_1x + a_3} \in \Omega_E

%
%
%\begin{prop}[Silverman III.5.1]
%Let $E$ and $\omega$ be as above, let $Q \in E$, and let $\tau_Q: E \to E$ be the translation-by-$Q$ map (III.4.7). Then

%\begin{thm}[Silverman III.5.2]
%Let $E$ and $E'$ be elliptic curves, let $\omega$ be an invariant differential on $E$ and let $\phi, \psi: E' \to E$ be isogenies. Then $(\phi + \psi)^* \omega= \phi^* \omega + \psi^* \omega$. 
%\end{thm}
%
%The two plus signs in this equation represent completely different operations. The first is addition in $\Hom(E',E)$, which is essentially addition using the group law on $E$. The second is the usual addition in the vector space of differentials $\Omega_{E'}$.

%\begin{cor}[Silverman III.5.4]
%Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve and let $m \in \Z$. Assume that $m \neq 0$ in $K$. Then the multiplication-by-$m$ map on $E$ is a finite separable endomorphism. 
%\end{cor}

%Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve and let $\omega$ be a nonzero invariant differential on $E$. We define a map from $\End E$ to $\ov{K}$ in the following way
%	\[
%	\End E \to \ov{K}, \phi \mapsto a_\phi \text{ such that } \phi^*\omega= a_\phi \omega
%	\]
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item The map $\phi \mapsto a_\phi$ is a ring homomorphism.
%\item The kernel of $\phi \mapsto a_\phi$ is the set of inseparable endomorphisms of $E$.
%\item If $\ch K= 0$, then $\End E$ is a commutative ring.

%\subsection{The Dual Isogeny} % p 80
%
%Let $\phi: E_1 \to E_2$ be a nonconstant isogeny. The maps $\phi^*$ and $\phi_*$ take divisors of degree 0 to divisors of degree 0, and principal divisors to principal divisors. They thus induce maps 
%	\[
%	\phi^*: \Pic^0(C_2) \to \Pic^0(C_1) \text{ and } \phi_*: \Pic^0(C_1) \to \Pic^0(C_2)
%	\]
%In particular, if $f \in \ov{K}(C)$ gives the map $f: C \to \bP^1$, then
%	\[
%	\deg \div f = \deg f^* \big( (0) - (\infty) \big)= \deg f - \deg f= 0.
%	\]
%Then $\phi$ induces a map
%	\[
%	\phi^*: \Pic^0(E_2) \to \Pic^0(E_1).
%	\]
%On the other hand, for $i= 1$ and 2 we have group homomorphisms 
%	\[
%	\kappa_i: E_i \to \Pic^0(E_i), P \mapsto \text{ class of } (P) - (\cO).
%	\]
%This gives a homomorphism going in the opposite direction to $\phi$, namely the composition 
%	\[
%	E_2 \ma{\kappa_2} \Pic^0(E_2) \ma{\phi^*} \Pic^0(E_1) \ma{\kappa_1^{-1}} E_1.
%	\]
%We will verify that the map may be computed as follows. Let $Q \in E_2$, and choose any $P \in E_1$ satisfying $\phi(P)= Q$. Then	
%	\[
%	\kappa_1^{-1} \circ \phi^* \circ \kappa_2(Q)= [\deg \phi](P).
%	\]
%It is by no means clear that the homomorphism $\kappa_1^{-1} \circ \phi^* \circ \kappa_2$ is an isogeny, i.e. that it is given by a rational map. The process of finding a point $P$ satisfying $\phi(P)= Q$ involves taking roots of various polynomial equations. If $\phi$ is separable, one needs to check that applying $[\deg \phi]$ to $P$ causes the conjugate roots to appear symmetrically. (It is actually reasonably clear that this is true if only explicitly write out $\kappa_1^{-1} \circ \phi^* \circ \kappa_2$). If $\phi$ is inseparable, this approach is more complicated. We will now show that in all cases there is an actual isogeny that may be computed in the manner described above.

%\begin{thm}[Silverman III.6.1]
%Let $\phi: E_1 \to E_2$ be a nonconstant isogeny of degree $m$.
%
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item There exists a unique isogeny 
%	\[
%	\hat{\phi}: E_2 \to E_1 \text{ satisfying } \hat{\phi} \circ \phi= [m]
%	\]
%
%\item As a group homomorphism, $\hat{\phi}$ equals the composition 
%	\[
%	\begin{aligned}
%	&E_2 \ma{} \Div^0(E_2) \ma{\phi^*} \Div^0(E_1) \ma{\text{sum}} E_1, \\
%	&Q \mapsto (Q) - (\cO) \quad\quad \sum n_P(P) \mapsto \sum [n_P]P

%
%
%\begin{dfn}
%Let $\phi: E_1 \to E_2$ be an isogeny. The dual isogeny to $\phi$ is the isogeny $\hat{\phi}: E_2 \to E_1$ described in III.6.1a. [This assumes that $\phi \neq [0]$. If $\phi= [0]$, then we set $\hat{\phi}= [0]$.] 
%\end{dfn}
%
%
%The next theorem gives the basic properties of the dual isogeny. From these basic facts, we will be able to deduce a number of very important corollaries, including a good description of the kernel of the multiplication-by-$m$ map.

%\begin{thm}[Silverman III.6.2]
%Let 
%	\[
%	\phi: E_1 \to E_2
%	\]
%be an isogeny. 
%
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item Let $m= \deg \phi$. Then
%	\[
%	\hat{\phi} \circ \phi= [m] \text{ on } E_1 \text{ and } \phi \circ \hat{\phi}= [m] \text{ on } E_2
%	\]
%
%\item Let $\lambda: E_2 \to E_3$ be another isogeny. Then
%	\[
%	\hat{\lambda \circ \phi}= \hat{\phi} \circ \hat{\lambda}
%	\]
%
%\item Let $\psi: E_1 \to E_2$ be another isogeny. Then
%	\[
%	\hat{\phi + \psi}= \hat{\phi} + \hat{\psi}
%	\]
%
%\item For all $m \in \Z$,
%	\[
%	\hat{[m]}= [m] \text{ and } \deg [m]= m^2
%	\]
%
%\item $\deg \hat{\phi}= \deg \phi$
%
%\item $\hat{\hat{\phi}}= \phi$. 
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{thm}

%
%\begin{dfn}
%Let $A$ be an abelian group. A function $d: A \to \R$ is a quadratic form if it satisfies the following conditions:

%	\item The pairing
%		\[
%		A \times A \to \R, \quad (\alpha,\beta) \mapsto d(\alpha + \beta) - d(\alpha) - d(\beta)

%	is bilinear. 
%	\end{enumerate}
%A quadratic form $d$ is positive definite if it further satisfies:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item[(iii)] $d(\alpha) \geq 0$ for all $\alpha \in A$.
%	\item[(iv)] $d(\alpha)= 0$ if and only if $\alpha= 0$.

%\begin{cor}[Silverman III.6.3]
%Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be elliptic curves. The degree map

%is a posit definite quadratic form.

%
%\begin{cor}[Silverman III.6.4]
%Let $E$ be an elliptic curve and let $m \in \Z$ with $m \neq 0$.
%
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item $\deg [m]= m^2$
%\item If $m \neq 0$ in $K$, i.e. if either $\ch K= 0$ or $p= \ch K > 0$ and $p \nmid m$, then

%	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
%	\item $E[p^e]= \{ \cO \}$ for all  $e= 1,2,3,\ldots$
